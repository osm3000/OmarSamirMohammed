<p>I am interested in machine learning, DIY electronics and 3D printing, and simulations.</p>

<p>I got my PhD in 2019, from the University of Grenoble-Alpes (France). My work is focused on using machine learning (mostly deep learning) to model, extract and transfer styles/personas.</p>

<p>I had a MSc degree in Machine Learning and Data Mining in 2016.</p>

<p>I had my engineering degree (BSc) from Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Egypt, specialized in electronics and communications.</p>

<p>In high school (equivalent to <em>Classe préparatoire</em> in France), I was ranked 120 over almost half a million student nation wide in Egypt, specialized in science (mathematics branch).</p>

<h1 id="boring-background--d">Boring background :-D</h1>

<p>Since as long as I can remember, I loved everything has to do with engineering and computers. I loved systems, and putting them together to form other systems, and so on.</p>

<p>During the time I worked in Siemens, my fascination with machine learning and optimization grew a lot. Two things motivated me to finally go there:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I stumbled upon two books that really changed my life: “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Automate-This-Algorithms-Markets-World/dp/1591846528/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Automate+This%3A+How+Algorithms+Took+Over+Our+Markets%2C+Our+Jobs%2C+and+the+World&amp;qid=1553653100&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1-fkmrnull">Automate This: How Algorithms Took Over Our Markets, Our Jobs, and the World</a>” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Spiritual-Machines-Computers-Intelligence/dp/0140282025/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence</a>”. My whole perspective about the world changed radically after reading these two books.</li>
  <li>I then did the machine learning course of Andrew Ng on Coursera. It was a fascinating experience, and a logical progression of material.</li>
</ul>

<p>This made me decide to leave my beloved Mentor Graphics, and do a masters degree.</p>

<p>At the beginning, the plan was to make the transition from electronics to machine learning in few years, while slowly introducing them to electronics. This is due to the fact that I didn’t have a CS background. So I choose to do a masters in embedded systems, while continuing on the side doing online courses in machine learning, and building my knowledge in CS.</p>

<p>Two months into the masters (March 2014), a dear friend convinced me that I can do this transition right now, without the need for my very cautious plan. It was the point of no return. I applied for three machine learning programs, and luckily got accepted in two (April 2014), and choose <a href="https://mldm.univ-st-etienne.fr/">MLDM</a>, to start in September 2014. From April to September, I decided to immediately drop my other masters, and focus 24/7 on online courses, to build and enhance my knowledge in CS and ML.</p>
