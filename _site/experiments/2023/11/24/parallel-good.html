    <p>Without fully understanding what is happening under the hood, parallelizing your code can lead to slower performance.</p>

<h1 id="context">Context</h1>
<p>I am working at the moment on evolutionary optimization for neural networks, to train agents to play games. To give a fitness for the neural network, the agent need to play N games (starting from random position), and the fitness is the average score of those N games. These N games are being played in parallel (using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multiprocessing</code> library in python).</p>

<p>In this case, I’ve 32 cores available, and I am running 32 games in parallel.</p>

<p>The stack here was simple: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code> for the code, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-arcade</code> for the game design, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pytorch</code> for the neural network, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pygmo</code> for the evolutionary optimization.</p>

<h1 id="the-problem">The problem</h1>
<p>The problem is that the speed of execution. It was abysmal. I was getting individual (aka: 32 games played) in ~5 seconds. This is a very long time for a super simple game. I was expecting something in the order of milliseconds.</p>

<p>In general, especially early on in the experimentation process, a long optimization time is always a sign of bad design, and that I am doing something wrong.</p>

<h1 id="the-investigation">The investigation</h1>
<p>My first thought was that it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-arcade</code> that is the problem. I went deep into the package, and had conversations with some of the developers on the discord channel. My suspicion was geared towards the game clock. Each game needs a ticking clock. The clock speed determines the number of frames per second. My hunch was that in a headless mode though, the same clock is being used, thus the bad performance (basically, in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">headless</code> mode, I want the clock to tick AS FAST AS POSSIBLE).</p>

<p>I was wrong: there was no clock in the headless mode. The problem was somewhere else.</p>

<p>My next thinking was: it has to be that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-arcade</code> itself is slow. This was a half-ass guess, but in this elimination process, I need to rule it out. So, I built a game engine from scratch (that operates on a matrix of ascii characters). Things can’t get any faster than this.</p>

<p>Run the optimization, and lo and behold….there is almost no gain whatsoever!</p>

<p>Almost ready to surrender, I then converted the multiprocessing evaluation into sequential evaluation, just to set a benchmark and record my observations for later. To my sheer surprise, the was a phenomenal gain in speed!</p>

<p>I need to dig a bit deeper into this (profile the code properly), but I am nearly confident now it is because of how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pytorch</code> works: the library is already very efficient in using the different cores. Having many instances of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pytorch</code> library is most likely to choke the available CPU resources, leading to this excessive delays.</p>

<p>I probably need to invest more on my debugging / profiling skills: elimination process is cool and effective, yet bloody expensive.</p>

<p>….hard lesson learned.</p>
