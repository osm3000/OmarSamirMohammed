1. Discuss more my views about relationship between the universe and information
2. Everything useful the universe creates is a tool to generate information
3. All tools have expiry date (there are no more information to generate), thus, requires an upgrade to a new level, or maybe complete deletion.
4. The value of a person is in information generation
	1. Babies were the main method 
	2. Now, we have more tools to generate
5. Levels of human value
	1. Learn to use/maintain a tool that create information (but you are not creating it, similar to computer maintaince or garbage collection for example)
	2. Use existing tools to create new information (use the current tools to generate/acquire info)
	3. Create new tools to create information (unlock a new potential to generate more information)
	4. Create tools that create tools: like platforms, programming languages, ...etc
	5. Create ideas that create tools that create tools: although technically the same as the prev point, it is a more pure form, extremely high value, hard to get (like inventing new math for example)
