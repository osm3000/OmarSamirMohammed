(A slightly modified version of the original post)

Good question. First of all, I'm in fond with engineering and technology. I see them always as a way of enhancing people's life, creating a better world for everyone.

Look around you, you'll find marvelous engineering everywhere.

You can change the whole course of history. Look at the computers, the mobiles, the cars, the airplanes. Too many things to count surrounding you.

I don't see engineering as just a craft. I see it as an art, a master piece of art.

What I'm trying here is to explore new technologies, new methods - mainly in digital design and electronics stuff -, and also, trying to think in a loud voice on the deep meaning of things, seeking the truth and the reality behind everything, and also how our designs are going to enhance our surrounding and the whole world.

Of course you'll ask: how is my design can change the world ?

You don't have to make a nuclear bomb so that its effect is clear to everyone. Butterfly effect is that a butterfly in the amazon can trigger a series of events that will cause a hurricane in Java.

So, think about first make designs that will enhance yourself, make your life much easier. There are always problems to be solved. Think small and grow bigger. I shall talk more about that in later posts.

And lastly, I want to say: Smile, be cheerful, think positively and always seek the good for you and for the others :)
