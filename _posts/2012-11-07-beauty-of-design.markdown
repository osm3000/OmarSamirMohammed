(A slightly modified version of the original post)

Let's face it. We've two directions controlling the world of most of engineers: either people who believe in logic only, or people believe they have chosen the wrong craft.

I'm not a veteran engineer. But I can tell you that there is something more than logic, science or math in engineering.

Design is about tasting the beauty of the nature, seeking the patterns and the great system the determines its behavior, then using your "taste" to make the engineering solution you're seeking. Equations and logic are just a part of the equation. 

You'll probably tell me: For god sake, how can I understand nature? 

I didn't ask you to understand. This is not right. This is like trying to see the frequency component of the signal in time domain.

I'm asking you to taste. Nature is about feeling.

Try to walk alone. See the beauty of God's creating around you. Look at the flower, look at closely, see the colors, the curves, the whole great design and system that this design has been based on. Look at the sky. Imagine those incredible planets there, with all their magnificent details and colors, every planet is a system of its own, and under every system there are many systems: The weather, the land, the gravity, ...etc. And all these planets are united in one system of our solar system, moving in an breath-taking system, so precise and beautiful.

Seek the beauty and elegance in your design. Seek all the details, even the minor ones. Everything matters. Everything counts.
