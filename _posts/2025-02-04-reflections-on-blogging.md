[A post on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42933383) triggered me to [read this post][link-id]. It talks about a comprehensive idea of blogging, on three different tiers:
1. Low stake: link blogging, sharing thoughts / things i learned
2. High stake: projects

Link blogging is particularly interesting. This is the equivalent of "re-posting" on Twitter. Simon advice the following though:
1. Write a summary of what I learned from it
2. Add something extra: examples
   1. Add context
   2. Enrich from my personal experience
   3. Link to other similar concepts

A key problem I've been struggling with is to communicating my work and my thoughts. I also want to do this in video format. I feel strongly that these long-term assets are what I should be investing in.

A motivation for me is to build the habit of writing and documenting regularly. Some projects I'm working are fairly complicated - by my own standards -, and it is easy that I end up losing track and not documenting my progress correctly. Daily blogging will be an interesting way to commit myself to document and reflect on the current steps.

Will, let's start!
