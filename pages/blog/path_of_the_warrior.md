I am having a lot of mixed emotions, questions and reflections recently about my identity and my core values. In other posts probably, I will shade more light on those reflections. But for now, I want to focus on a particular point, that I keep returning to all my life: the warrior approach to life. 

When I was young, either due to the way I was raised, or to the environment and events surrounding me, I grew this *militaristic* feelings and identity. I always found that in war is where I truly belong, and that my relationships with people is through the *comradeship* and *brotherhood* that rise in the battlefield. I had deep affection to military history and war stories, and despise for peace. Peace was always a way to spoil men with the luxury of living.

For a very long time when I was in Egypt, I maintained this *warrior* mentality, being on high-alert and mission-driven, living by the sword. When one battle is over, the preparations for the new battle starts. When the war is over, a new war begins. It did deeply affect my personality, and definitely had negative and positive impacts; when you go to the extreme ends, you get the extremes of both sides as well. On the top of my head:
1. Negative
   1. Generally tired, a deep fatigue that is hard to explain
   2. Emotionally confused: I don't really know if/when people like me or hate me
   3. My understanding of the society
2. Positive
   1. Sheer decisiveness
   2. Aggressiveness and risk taking
   3. My mind grew a lot from the continuos wars/adventures


France did change me a lot.

Yet, with all of that, my feelings keep converging to this primitive feelings...the warrior path, the isolation from society, the life by the sword, the sheer focus and purity, the clutter of modern life.
