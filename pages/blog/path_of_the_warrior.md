I am having a lot of mixed emotions, questions and reflections recently about my identity and my core values. In other posts probably, I will shade more light on those reflections. But for now, I want to focus on a particular point, that I keep returning to all my life: the warrior approach to life. 

When I was young, either due to the way I was raised, or to the environment and events surrounding me, I grew this *militaristic* feelings and identity. I always found that in war is where I truly belong, and that my relationships with people is through the *comradeship* and *brotherhood* that rise in the battlefield. I had deep affection to military history and war stories, and despise for peace. Peace was always a way to spoil men with the luxury of living.

For a very long time when I was in Egypt, I maintained this *warrior* mentality, being on high-alert and mission-driven, living by the sword. When one battle is over, the preparations for the new battle starts. When the war is over, a new war begins. It did deeply affect my personality, and definitely had negative and positive impacts; when you go to the extreme ends, you get the extremes of both sides as well. On the top of my head:
1. Negative
   1. Generally tired, a deep fatigue that is hard to explain
   2. Emotionally confused: I find it hard to project others feelings about me. In a consistent fashion, what people say is not what they mean (it is not about intentional lying, it is just a human nature and social values). Hiding is part of the social games that are continuously being played. I no longer take an praise or good description from anyone, however close they are or trusted they are, and I am more and more building a harsh stand against personal criticism for me as well (although I am welling to listen, reach out, and work problems whenever possible).
   3. My understanding of the society has been more analytical then emotional: due to the nature of the way I understand things, and the high variation of social values that I experienced during over my life (13 cities so far over 3 continents), I advanced a lot in developing techniques to "hack" the social fabric and understand it. Recent few years witnessed accelerated progress in that regard. While pretty successful, it also developed this personal disentanglement from the society...I became a pretty good actor (I think), but not a good member. 
   4. I believe in problem solving: which is a feeling not shared with many. People are strongly driven by "gut" feelings, something I've little understanding of. Time and time again, my efforts in understanding problems and finding out solutions proves of little use, highly unsuccessful, futile at best.  
   5. There is no win that is enough: all gold turns into dust when I touch it, but then I become illusion of another mirage of yet long anticipated gold, far in the horizon. A life of hallucinations, rainbows and unicorns.
2. Positive
   1. Sheer decisiveness
   2. Aggressiveness and risk taking
   3. My mind grew a lot from the continuos wars/adventures/stimulus/experiences
   4. The willing to lose more and more: very little has became precious to me, and it is getting less and less over time. I am withdrawing me to value and keep intellectual things (my ideas, my experiments, logic, writing, beautiful discussions...etc), and add intellectual properties to materialistic thing (my computer, my tools, my books, my pen and paper, ...etc). While the circle of people around me continues to grow (to my sheer surprise), the circle inside me continues to shrink and drift in a different direction.

France did change me a lot. While I may didn't have the chance in Egypt to feel a big contrast between my approach and society (hard life, sheer effort to achieve any trivial thing, everyone is waiting to die and have a better life after), the contrast was enormous in Europe. People are living in a relative peace of mind. On the surface, the problems here seems very trivial compare to anything, but this is a gross misunderstanding of the life in general and the society in particular. Every problem and value gain its importance rating in a context. It is hard for me to communicate the the importance of the problems we faced in Egypt to people here, and the other way around; the best way is to listen, respect, and appreciate the differences, and be thankful for these beautiful moments where we can share our experiences, and for the trust and confidence people put in me when they do that. Overtime, the communication gets better, never perfect, and I find the imperfection to be a beautiful facet of this whole experience. 

This life of peace was interrupted by a sequence of wars for me. The learning curve was steep, the cost was enormous, and the threat was high. I was shifting to a new domain (machine learning), and establishing myself consumed brutal efforts. Financial issues, PhD problems, identity papers, ....etc all posed massive risks at the time.

Yet still, peace prevailed. I am blessed with the wonderful people I met throughout this journey; everyone taught me sometime, took my hand a step further, and made a mark on my character. For this, I shall always be grateful. Peace, ah, finally, well deserved, and I finally have the skill to understand it, and enjoy it.

Yet, with all of that, my feelings keep converging to this primitive feelings...the warrior path, the isolation from society, the life by the sword, the sheer focus and purity, the clutter of life. It is a weird tendency, a call in the wild, hard to explain. My feeling is that I am not a domestic dog, I am a wild wolf; I can show acts of domestication, but deep inside I belong to the wildness. There is a continuous fire waging in me, that is still refusing to ease. Still eager for war, for the illusion, and for comrades. 

Like an actor in a war movie, who mixed the reality with the role he is acting...

Reminds me of an episode of Dr.House, I guess, where there were these two guys, extremely committed all their life to live in the american civil war period, and all its details. That is their lives. They build their box and stayed inside it. 

While easy to make these judgement, I simple fact is that I don't know which is the box, the reality and the imagination. I know them as abstract items, but no longer have a projection for them. I've some relative projections - I clearly have my opinions -, but are they relevant? Even in the wisdom of knowing that things are relevant, a part of me is eager for a more solid and unquestionable rock of truth, a north star reference...
