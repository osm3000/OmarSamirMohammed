# "Walking with the Dinosaurs" documentary: thoughts and reflections

Recently I re-watched the old *Walking with the Dinosaurs* documentary from BBC. It is a classic for people who loved dinosaurs - especially for me as a child, obsessed with Jurassic Park movie -.

One of the things that really struck deep this time is how tiny we are in the scale of the whole planet. Each episode, it starts with the estimation of the time the events took place (~200 million years ago, ~150 million...etc). The numbers are just enormous, it is hard to make sense of it. In the same time, the way life evolved over this very long period is truly amazing, from the diversity of the creatures, to their continuos adaptation to the changes in the environment. It feels as if change is mandatory in the universe.

It also makes me wonder about how we view ourselves in the midst of all of that: the way we consider ourselves at the ultimate control, the way we try to predict the future, the way we think we are in control...etc, it seems foolish.

We are really so small in face of all that history, and we don't yet absorb the knowledge and the wisdom developed over this whole period of time, yet we dream so big (which is impressive). One might argue that we are an embodiment of the history of life on earth, given that we are a result of evolutionary processes that shapes this planet over hundreds of millions of years.

Another thing I felt, and it was reflected by an [interview with Stephen Fry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39ya2Drpj3s) about his book about bears: animals are only concerned about being themselves, bears being bears, elephants being elephants...except humans, we want to be someone/something else. Biased by this idea, it is easy to reflect upon it while watching the dinosaurs documentary.

Can we really manage the challenges that lie ahead, from global warming, population increase, pollution, ...etc? Do we have the knowledge and wisdom to save ourselves, and other species on this planet? Can we control nature, or at least some aspects of it? One wonders...
