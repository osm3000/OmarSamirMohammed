# About

I have finished my PhD in machine learning, November 2019, at [GIPSA-lab](www.gipsa-lab.fr/), CRISSP team, [University of Grenoble-Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). My work focused is on style extraction and action generation for human activity, using deep neural networks.

I did my masters degree in [Machine Learning and Data Mining](https://mldm.univ-st-etienne.fr/), a collaborative program between University of Jean-Monnet (Saint-Etienne, France) and University of Alicante (Alicante, Spain), class 2016.

I have an engineering degree in electronics and communications from Alexandria Faculty of Engineering (Alexandria, Egypt).
