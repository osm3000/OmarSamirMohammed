Last year, I've joined Entrepreneur-First program, 5th Paris cohort. The idea is simple: they gather a group of people with potential in technology or business, 
they give some money and sometime, and...starting dating. The objective is to form a team of two, CEO and CTO. Lectures and mentorship are provided during 3-4 months 
period, and this culminates in the big event, the Investment Committee, which decides whether to invest a pre-seed money with you are not. With that, congratulations, 
the road is open.
