(A slightly modified version of the original post)

This is a [great video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdDU_BBJW9Y&feature=my_favorites&list=FL1Cw0ExJ8FznJvmShp-lXMQ), that will show you how art, system and design can be united in one single coherent unit.

Remember: Smile, be cheerful, think positively and always seek the good for you and for the others :)
