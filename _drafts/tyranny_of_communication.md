I want to discuss more here about my struggle with Asperger, and how I see communication to be a daunting task in general.
1. My personal story and origins: early suffering
2. Programming, and how fax-modem, ADC/DAC gave me the idea to simulate reality
3. The immense social success that came after
4. Two-identities: disentanglement of behavior and emotion
5. It is always there: social anxiety, rejection, inability/fear of going far in relationships
6. Observing the suffering of others: while I am lucky to have developed techniques to communicate, many others were not that lucky, ending as outcasts of society
7. Society is far from being inclusive for different neural tribes. An effort in communication and understanding is needed. Similar to gay movement. 
8. How technology can help us communicate better?
9. Communication is not just verbal language and body language (the most valued two aspects of communication): engineering is a form of communication, so as visual aspects
10. Embrace the difference, it is an opportunity
