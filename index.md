I am a 2nd year PhD student at [GIPSA-lab](www.gipsa-lab.fr/), CRISSP team, [University of Grenoble-Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). My work focus is on style extraction and action generation for human activity, using deep neural networks.

I did my masters degree in [Machine Learning and Data Mining](https://mldm.univ-st-etienne.fr/), a collaborative program between University of Jean-Monnet (Saint-Etienne, France) and University of Alicante (Alicante, Spain), class 2016.

Interests: Deep Learning, Adversarial Learning, Evolutionary Optimization.

<!-- ### Welcome to GitHub Pages.
This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.

### Designer Templates
We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.

### Creating pages manually
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
